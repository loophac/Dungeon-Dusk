A board game based on dungeon diving with insane twists, vile bosses, and infuriating concepts.
This game, it's art*, design and property belong solely to Christian Doucette.

However, the cards and manuals are open-source, allowing for players or members of its community to request new cards or concepts of the game. 
The game is currently in Pre-Packaged Beta v1.0, meaning all cards and manuals have not been printed but are in working order.

All changes to the game can be requested via a proper pull request. Enjoy!
