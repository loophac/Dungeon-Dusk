10 health
5 attack
2 defense
The Rogue is able to avoid combat by sneaking when they choose to enter a room alone. 
A Rogue needs to roll a D6 and get higher than a 4 (unless changed by an ability) in order to successfully sneak. 
Failing to sneak results in -2 defense. All teammates take 1 turn each to enter room as well once a rogue sneaks.
