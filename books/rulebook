Welcome to Dungeon Dusk! The first ever Open-Source RPG card game! There is much learn so let's get right into it!

Chapter 1: Basic Rules

Getting Started:

This game is for 4-8 players. Each of the players at the beginning of the game must choose their class from the 8 classes provided. 
When this is done, assign turn order to all players and you are ready to begin. Be sure to hand out any accompanying books to
the players who class they apply to. For instance, the Mage should be given the Book of Magic, the Priest given the Book of Blessings, 
and the Chemist given the Book of Recipes. Be sure to have a pen and paper nearby as well for the Mage, Yeoman, and Blacksmith. 
The Mage needs it in order to keep track of their mana, and the Yeoman and Blacksmith need it in order to keep track of their
strength.

Order your Room and Chest card decks into two piles. Each turn, a player will take a turn to "lead the group", meaning they are the one 
who draws the door card. The player who draws the door card on their turn "opens the door", enters the room with the team but is the 
only one who can collect anything in it. This player can gift items they acquire to teammates at any time. 

A player can choose to enter the room alone or with the team. The player can also choose who stays and who goes into the room with them. 
When you draw a door card, it means you've entered that room. If the door card is a monster, it means there is a monster in that room
and you must kill it before you leave. Loot is dependant upon the monster you kill and whether or not it drops loot. Some monsters,
for instance, will say "Roll D6 > 4 for two chest items." This means that after you kill the monster, roll a D6 and if you get 
a 4 or higher, you can draw 2 Chest cards. Only the leader at that turn can collect the loot from the monster or boss.

During combat with a monster, after each player who is in the room takes their attack turn, two D6 dice must be rolled. Since
each player has a number (first to take their turn, second, third, etc) use the same order to assign to every even number that can be 
rolled during the combats 2D6 roll. For instance, if you role a 4 with both dice, the second player in the order of turns takes damage
from that monster. If you roll a 5, the monster misses its attack. Be sure to do this after each time someone attacks the monster and 
the monster is still alive.

If the door card is an item, you can collect that item and end your turn. If the door is a chest and requires a key, you can use the
key if you have it that turn or "hold the room". Holding the room is when you set that door card aside and end your turn. If at any point y
you find the correct key needed, you can roll a D6 to get back to that room. However, if you roll a 1-3, that means you failed to find
the room again. If you fail after 3 attempts, you lose the room and have to put it into your discard pile. If you roll a 4-6, you find the 
room and are able to open the chest. A player can only hold room at a time. 

In order to win the game, the players must kill all 4 bosses.
